            <p>Below are some of my skills that I'm proud of.</p>

                <h3>Explorer</h3>
                <img src="image/skills1.jpeg" alt="Explorer" />
                <p>I am the type of person who like to explore new things. I believe that to unlock some talents, I need to be brave and try a lot of things. Thus, I can be more confident too in my abilities.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Creativity</h3>
                <img src="image/skills2.jpeg" alt="Creativity" />
                <p>Creativity is a part of my skill. I like to do some art and I think I'm pretty good at learning it too. I am a fast learner and I like to show the results with my people.</p>

                <h3>Adaptability</h3>
                <img src="image/skills3.jpeg" alt="Adaptability" />
                <p>I believe that I am an adaptable person. For example, I didn't know how to play Go-Kart racing at first. I tried to ride, and surprisingly, I got better at it over time. Practice makes perfect. I managed to ride it well afterwards.</p>

                <p>I like to do activities or play games together with people. In short, I like teamwork activities or events. I realize that I get more energy from it and I'm happy. Teamwork makes the dream work, and I have a good balance in teamwork. I was the leader for a few groups before, and with my teamwork skills and my team members' cooperation, we managed to produce great work.</p>

                <p>I started to dance since I was a kid. I'm not a professional, but I'm good at Zumba. When I was in high school, I held the position of president of the Zumba club in my school. I have done some performances and joined dance competitions. It was one of my hobbies and I really enjoyed it. Tap the video to see me dance hihii</p>
