                        <h2>Skill Development</h2>
                        <p>One of the examples of my work with the Adobe Photoshop application is the animation above. As a student, I believe there are no limits and boundaries to to improve and grow to become a better person. My goal as a student is to be multi-talented. This fourth semester has taught me a lot of new skills, such how to use Adobe and learn HTML. My goal is to advance and strengthen my abilities so that I can utilize them in the future.</p>

                    <div class="goal-content">
                        <h2>Academic Excellence</h2>
                        <p>I think that students can find great motivation in aiming for academic excellence. Being one of the best students would be nice, if it were possible. This could be establishing clear goals for my grades, studying difficult classes to broaden my knowledge base. I believe I can achieve my goals if I work really hard. Being as attractive and intelligent as actress Emma Watson is something I would cherish. To put it briefly, I want to graduate with honors and make my family very proud of me.

                        <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
                        <p>As far as I'm aware, university is a crucial period for personal development and self-discovery. Setting personal development goals, in my opinion, can help you grow your emotional intelligence, resilience in the face of adversity, and self-confidence. Insyaallah, I aspire to grow into the best version of myself and work toward excellence gradually but steadily.</p>

                        <h2>Health and Fitness</h2>
                        <p>I think that establishing physical well-being goals can help you live a better, more active life. Having been an athlete in the past, I truly put my health first because it makes it easier for me to go about my everyday activities. This might include objectives like finishing a marathon, dropping a specific amount of weight, starting a fitness regimen, and developing better eating habits since, at the moment, I don't really take care of it due to my hectic schedules. I'm hoping to get back on track and resume living a healthy life.</p>

                        <h2>Travel and Exploration</h2>
                        <p>If possible, I would really like to visit another foreign nation, such as Istanbul in Turkey or Rome in Italy. If I can afford it, I want to go there. I'll put in as much effort as I can to reach my objectives and take my family on a global vacation adventure. I have always like traveling to new locations and learning about different cultures because it allows me to learn more fascinating information.

                        <h2>Courage and Determination</h2>
                        <p>Growing older has made me realize that I lack the bravery to advocate for myself, so I would wish to possess the strength and determination of Disney princess Mulan. She is incredibly bold, and I would wish to have that courage. Whether it's conquering personal challenges, going after your ideal job, or sticking up for your convictions. I think that by improving and believing in myself, I will gain courage, determination, and confidence in anything I do. Since practice makes perfect, I'm hoping to succeed.
