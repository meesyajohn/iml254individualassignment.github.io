            <p>A friendship is a relationship based on empathy and understanding that endures beyond time and space. True friends never leave each other's hearts, no matter how far apart they are. They share in our happiness and grief, listen to us without passing judgment, and offer unconditional support. Being apart and nothing changing is what defines true friendship, not being inseparable. I have many friends, but the ones I am closest to are listed below.</p>

                    <h2>Aleeya Àö ö‚ô°…ûÀö</h2>
                    <p>Kakcik, my second sister, is another name for Aleeya. I considered Kakcik to be my best buddy since we were so close. She is one of the individuals I trust and adore, so I feel extremely comfortable telling her everything. Her brave, honest, trustworthy, and compassionate demeanor really impresses me. Even while Kakcik is my biological sister, she will always be my best buddy when it comes to expressing myself. She looks after me really well, which is why I adore her so much. She will buy me gifts and spoil me with a ton of delicious food. She never says no to me, corrects me when I make mistakes, and never chastises me. Since we agree not to keep anything private between us, she is really aware about every detail of me even my secrets huhu. I hope she continues to be prosperous and well so that we may spend a very long time together and I can repay her back. In a nutshell, Kakcik is my greatest friend and someone I can always rely on. The ideal song to sum up our sisterhood and best friend bond is below.</p>

                    <p>Another name for Soffiah is Soffi. She and I became good buddies after I started university life. She and I had been close friends since our first semester. Soffi is incredibly giving and nice. She is constantly so generous to others that it becomes a hardship for her. Soffi has bravery and charm in abundance. She is an inspiration to me since she dares to take on any barrier. Furthermore, despite her busy schedule, Soffi always agrees to assist me when I seek for support. In addition, Soffi is someone I truly respect since she never holds back when speaking her mind. She may be a little clumsy, but she constantly tries to stop it from happening, which I think is adorable and amazing. Even though Soffi and I have just been best friends for the past two years, it feels like we've known each other for ten years, and I think it's adorable that she can recall every detail about me.  Soffi is always very generous to me. Because Soffi has never betrayed a promise to me, I have a great deal of faith in her. I'm happy we got to meet. Soffi deserves the best, so I will always hope for the best for her.

                    <h2>Raudhah Íí∞·ê¢. .·ê¢Íí±</h2>
                    <p>Raudhah and I have been close friends since elementary school. Our elementary and middle schools were the same. We are moving like crazy, going everywhere in unison. Together, we have created several memories that include competing in account competitions, dancing competitions, and many other events. We get together frequently and even go to one another's homes. We live too close to each other for our families not to know one another. My mother didn't often let me go out, but she would let me if I said Raudhah's name. Because she is sincere and kind hearted, Raudhah is one of my friends that I can trust. Although we don't get to see each other very often, we are still getting along and didn't become awkward with each other even though it's been a long time that we haven't met. I miss you so so much. To sum up, I hope our friendship lasts till heaven and will always pray the best for you! To sum up, she is one of my friends that I can count on too. Down below is the song that I would choose to describe our friendship.</p>

                    <h2>Husna üçì‚äπ‚Çä ‚ãÜ</h2>
                    <p>Husna embodies a unique blend of kindness, perfectionism, and humility that has endeared her to me since the moment we became roommates. Her meticulous attention to detail in everything she does reflects her perfectionist nature, yet she carries herself with such humility that it's truly admirable. As a roommate, she goes above and beyond, always ensuring my comfort and well-being without ever making a fuss about it. Husna's exceptional quality as a listener has been a pillar of support for me through both laughter and tears.  What sets Husna apart is her protective nature, not in an overbearing way, but rather in a manner that shows she genuinely cares about my happiness and safety. While we've had our fair share of misunderstandings, the strength of our friendship shines through in our ability to resolve conflicts and emerge even stronger than before. As I reflect on the two semesters we've spent as roommates, I couldn't be more grateful to have Husna by my side. She epitomizes the qualities of a true friend, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have her in my life. Below is the song that describe our friendship.</p>

                    <p>Nurin, affectionately known as Rin, brings a delightful blend of goofiness, generosity, and a happy-go-lucky attitude that lights up any room she enters. Her infectious laughter and boundless energy never fail to uplift my spirits, making even the dreariest days feel brighter. Despite her carefree demeanor and sometimes crazy mood swings, Nurin possesses a remarkable ability to listen attentively and offer genuine support whenever I need a friend to lean on. Her quick wit and sense of humor add a layer of joy to our interactions, turning everyday moments into cherished memories filled with laughter. What truly stands out about Nurin is her protective nature, always looking out for those she cares about without being overbearing. While our friendship has encountered its fair share of challenges, we've always found a way to navigate through them, emerging stronger and closer than ever before. Reflecting on the time we've spent together, I'm grateful for Nurin's presence in my life. She embodies the essence of true friendship, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have her as a confidante and companion on life's journey.  Below is the song that describe our friendship.</p>
